# Just_Eat_Cycles_project

First of all: this notebook contains Folio maps. For this reason it's better to look at this notebook on this page: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/carlos108108/Just_Eat_Cycles_project/blob/main/Edinburgh.ipynb


Project:
Just Eat Cycles is a company in Scotland. Since September 2018 they have operated 24/7 bikesharing in Edinburgh. Each ride is recorded so we received a table containing more than 400 000 rows consist of data, e.g. name of stations, their location (latitude, longitude), duration etc.

The second table was about weather in Edinburg. 8 record for each day (3 hour step) helped us to analyze if and how bike rental depends on weather condition.

Then we need to check data very carefully and prepare tables for our work.

A descriptive statistic was obligatory.

The next task was to find out how variable demand for borrowing over time is.

Another issue is about fact that bikes could accumulated at particular stations and obviously at other stations could be a lack of bikes.

And we also analyze distances between all stations.
